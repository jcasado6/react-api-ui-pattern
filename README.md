# NASA Modal 

## Technologies Used
* JavaScript       
* React.js
* Rest API 

## Description & Features
This application was built in order to put my fundamental React.js, JavaScript, and API skills to the test. The user is able to see images rendered from the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API. When the user clicks an image, the information within the modal is also rendered from the API call.

## Getting Started
* Visit the deployed URL [here](https://nasa-modal.netlify.com/) or... 
* Fork and clone the repository and open the code in your preferred text editor.
* Open a tab in your terminal, or in your text editor, execute the command
##### `npm start`
* A new page in your browser will open and you can begin to interact with the application.

## Goals
In the future, I would like to improve this project by...
* Having an input field where the user can type in a date and the app will fire an API call and render the image and information for the date specified.
